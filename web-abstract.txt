The setoid interpretation gives rise to a model of a type theory with functional
extensionality, and a universe of propositions where equality is propositional
equivalence. The setoid model has been recently adapted into Setoid Type Theory
(SeTT) via a syntactic translation into a very basic target type theory. We
would like to equip SeTT with a universe of setoids, which is not a setoid but
which equality instead reflects equality of codes.

We can encode this universe by induction-recursion, however we donâ€™t want to
assume inductive-recursive types in the target type theory.  We know that some
instances of induction-recursion can be translated to inductive families using
the equivalence of I-indexed families of sets and sets over I. Our result is
that a modified form of this translation also works for our more complicated
universe of setoids. However, we now need an infinitary inductive-inductive type
in the target theory.

Is not clear whether the know translation of finitary inductive-inductive
definitions into inductive families extends to our infinitary case. This is
subject of further work, which if successful would provide a translation of the
setoid model with a universe into a very basic core type theory.
