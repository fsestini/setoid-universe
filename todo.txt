 * discussion: W-types in Prop, completeness, we present a model in a
   weak metalanguage, so it can also be seen as a construction on
   models

 * target theory: MLTT+U+Π+Σ+0+1+2+iW+Prop+ElP+⊥+iWinProp

 * Christian: canonicity in the traditional way

 * mention relationship to XTT: XTT is like internal categories, while
   SeTT is like enriched categories. XTT is defined as a CwF in
   cubical sets. they don't have a translation. but the universe
   construction is simpler

 * FILIPPO, AMBRUS: equations of SeTT:

   - (Π A B) ~T needs to be changed to not use implicit arguments
   
   - (Π A B) ~T needs to be changed to use truncation and Σ types so
     that the Π~ rule of SeTT is valid

   - equations given by the universe

   - also for other types

 * AMBRUS. reduction of in-U/in-U~ to W-types

   to check: it seems in the target theory with the ind-ind universe,
   we only use the simple elimination principle for the ind-ind type
   to define El~, etc, so we don't need the full reduction. we think
   that the simple elim principle can be defined without funext.

   OLD TEXT:

     1. The reduction of the Con-Ty infinitary IIT to W-types works
        inside setoid type theory, so it seems that we don't need IITs
        in setoid type theory, they can just be defined from W-types. In
        other words, SeTT+IITs can be reduced to SeTT.

     2. This doesn't immediately apply to the IIT defining the universe
        because that also relies on an existing universe, so we only
        know how to reduce SeTT+UAsIIT reduced to SeTT+U, but we don't
        have U.

     3. But we should be able to do some combined version where we only
        need some extensionality. Maybe using 2-level type theory: the
        fibrant level is that of setoids, the outer layer is usual
        intensional type theory.

 * Thorsten wants to trash this: coeRefl and coeTrans

   - add them to the model, see
     e.g. https://bitbucket.org/akaposi/setoid/src/master/agda/ModelR/Decl.agda

   - coeRefl for El (using the Kan extension trick) -- no need to
     change in-U/in-U~

   - do these rules work for quotient types, and QIITs?

   - why on Earth would Thorsten want to trash them?

     1. in the setoid model, we define these equalities as
        propositional equalities of functions, and these don't work
        well with colimits -- what is an example of a colimit where
        this would be a problem?

     2. we can define Martin-Löf's identity type, it has definitional
        β, but it is not in Prop

     3. if we externalise the setoid model, these become propositional
        equalities of the target theory in the empty context

     4. if we require the target theory to have equality reflection in
        the empty context (canonicity for Id), we get them as external
        equalities, so we really get definitional transportβ

     5. however, if we do not define the setoid model internally, but
        as a construction on CwFs (setoidification), then we can
        directly add these equalities as external equalities, and
        there is no problem with equalities of function spaces

 * transport for sets:

   from a model of

     MLTT+Prop+Id : A → A → Prop + transport (P : A → Prop) → Id a a' → P a → P a'

   we get a model of

     MLTT+Prop+Id : A → A → Prop + transport (P : A → Set)  → Id a a' → P a → P a'

   construction:

   Eq Δ : Sub Γ Δ → Sub Γ Δ → Prop
   iterated Prop-valued Id

   transport (A : Ty Γ) → Tm Γ (Eq Γ γ γ') → Tm Γ (A[γ]) → Tm Γ (A[γ']) by induction on Γ
   transport (A : Ty ∙)   _                u          :=  u
   transport (A : Ty (Γ,A))(e : Eq Γ γ γ')(f : Id A (... α) α') u :=
      transport A[...] f (transport (A[fix α]) e u)

 * it seems that the rules for homogeneous equality (that e.g. Andras
   is using in his implementation) are justified by the alternative
   version of the setoid model: see agda/SetoidHom
