 * can we do the universe construction in the homogeneous version of the setoid model?
   see https://bitbucket.org/akaposi/qiit/src/master/SetoidAlt/

 * reduction of in-U/in-U~ to W-types

   1. The reduction of the Con-Ty infinitary IIT to W-types works
      inside setoid type theory, so it seems that we don't need IITs
      in setoid type theory, they can just be defined from W-types. In
      other words, SeTT+IITs can be reduced to SeTT.

   2. This doesn't immediately apply to the IIT defining the universe
      because that also relies on an existing universe, so we only
      know how to reduce SeTT+UAsIIT reduced to SeTT+U, but we don't
      have U.

   3. But we should be able to do some combined version where we only
      need some extensionality. Maybe using 2-level type theory: the
      fibrant level is that of setoids, the outer layer is usual
      intensional type theory.

   Ambrus looks at it

 * equations of SeTT:

   - (Π A B) ~T needs to be changed to not use implicit arguments
   
   - (Π A B) ~T needs to be changed to use truncation and Σ types so
     that the Π~ rule of SeTT is valid

   - also for other types

 * Thorsten wants to trash this: coeRefl and coeTrans

   - add them to the model, see
     e.g. https://bitbucket.org/akaposi/setoid/src/master/agda/ModelR/Decl.agda

   - coeRefl for El (using the Kan extension trick) -- no need to
     change in-U/in-U~

   - why on Earth would Thorsten want to trash them?

     1. in the setoid model, we define these equalities as
        propositional equalities of functions, and these don't work
        well with colimits -- what is an example of a colimit where
        this would be a problem?

     2. we can define Martin-Löf's identity type, it has definitional
        β, but it is not in Prop

     3. if we externalise the setoid model, these become propositional
        equalities of the target theory in the empty context

     4. if we require the target theory to have equality reflection in
        the empty context (canonicity for Id), we get them as external
        equalities, so we really get definitional transportβ

     5. however, if we do not define the setoid model internally, but
        as a construction on CwFs (setoidification), then we can
        directly add these equalities as external equalities, and
        there is no problem with equalities of function spaces

 * about homogeneous equality: it seems that the rules for homogeneous
   equality (that e.g. Andras is using in his implementation) are
   justified by the alternative version of the setoid model:
