# setoid-universe

Source code and accompanying Agda formalization for the paper *Constructing a universe for the setoid model*, T. Altenkirch, S. Boulier, A. Kaposi, C. Sattler & F. Sestini, 2021 (link [here](https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-030-71995-1_1))

This repository is forked from the [bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/taltenkirch/setoid-univ) linked to the paper.
There are additional Agda files not included in the paper or the bitbucket repo, which instead formalize subsequent original content covered by my PhD thesis (link coming soon). These are the following:

* `Setoid/Sets/gen-elim.agda`: implementation of the general eliminators for the universe IIT encoded via inductive families, with definitional Î²-equations.
* `Setoid/UnivElim-SetsII.agda`: universe eliminator/typecase for the inductive-inductive universe.
* `Setoid/Sets3.agda` and `Setoid/Sets3/*.agda`: alternative formulation of the universe IIT encoded via inductive families. This variant uses mini IR universes for indexing, instead of `Set` and `Prop`. It also supports general eliminators.
* `Setoid/UnivElim-Sets3.agda`: universe eliminator for the `Sets3` variant.
