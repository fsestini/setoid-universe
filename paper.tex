\section{Introduction}

...


Intensional Type Theory has nice computational properties, like decidability of
type-checking, that can make it more suitable for computer formalization, since
proof-checking can be implemented as an entirely automatic procedure.
%
However, a serious drawback of ITT is given by the lack of extensionality.
%
Two extensionality principles are particularly missed from intensional type
theory, in that they arguably constitute the bare minimum for type theory to be
comparable to set theory as a foundational system for set-level mathematics.
%
The first of these is functional extensionality, i.e. the principle according to
which two functions can be considered equal if they map equal inputs to equal
outputs.
%
The second principle is propositional extensionality, according to which two
propositions should be considered equal when logically equivalent.

These extensionality principles are not theorems of intensional type theory as
usually defined [cite], although they are consistent with it [cite].
%
As a consequence, these principles are often added as axioms when formalizing
mathematics using proof-assistants based on ITT. This solution, however, is far
from optimal, as the introduction of axioms destroys the nice computational
properties of the system, particularly canonicity. Unfortunately, one can show
that whenever equality is defined according to the usual inductive definition by
Martin-Loef, there is no hope to have a theory where both canonicity and
funext/propext coexist.

The first step out of this is to give up the idea of equality as a single
inductive definition. Instead, equality should be defined specifically for each
type former in the type theory. That is, every type former $A$ should be
introduced together with its own notion of equality $A^\sim$.
%
If one does this, then funext can be obtained by simply defining equality on
function types to be point-wise equality. That is, $(A \to B)^\sim\ f\ g :\equiv
\forall (x : A) , B^\sim\ (f x)\ (g x)$.

%% * One possible answer: setoids

This form of extensional reasoning is already available in type theory via
\emph{setoids}. A setoid is just a type $A$ (in this setting, we assume that all
types are sets in the HoTT sense) together with a propositional equivalence
relation $A^\sim : A \to A \to \Prop$.
%
One can thus reason extensionally in ITT by defining an internal notion of
setoid, and working with those instead of normal sets/types. Note that this
approach only works provided one ensures that every construction performed on
setoids respects the setoid relations involved. Unfortunately doing so is not an
easy task, and most constructions beyond the more trivial ones will generate a
great amount of proof obligations, especially when dependent setoids come into
play, leading to a situation commonly known as \emph{setoid hell}.

%% * Setoid TT: MLTT + setoid constructs

The good news is that all this work proving that our type theoretic
constructions respect the setoid relations is not necessary, because these
already respect setoid equality \emph{by construction}. More precisely, there
exists a sound interpretation of MLTT (with pi, sigma, etc...) into setoids,
that maps closed types/contexts to setoids and dependent types to indexed
setoids.
%
Thus there is no need to explicitly work with setoids and setoid relations in
TT, as one can simply carry out their constructions in plain MLTT and use the
aforementioned interpretation to map that construction into the world of setoid.

This is interesting in principle, but practically useless. Since our
constructions still take place in MLTT, we can't take advantage of the features
of the setoid model our syntactic constructions are mapped to, since they are
not accessible internall, from within the system itself.
%
This is where a key property of models comes into play. Models inform consistent
extensions of the type theory, based on what holds true in the model, by
reflecting the semanics into the syntax via additional syntactic constructs that
are then mapped back to the original notions via the semantics.

In our case, the existence of a setoid model suggests us ways to extend the
syntax of MLTT with syntactic constructs that correspond to the setoid
relations, allowing us to access and use them when proving theorems within the
theory.
%
This is the idea behind Setoid Type Theory, SeTT for short.

* Two incarnations of ITT that follow this approach are OTT and cubical TT. In OTT
... TODO. In cubical TT ... TODO. Note that we do not include HoTT in the
discussion since, although it is a version of ITT with extensional properties,
it's not yet known to enjoy canonicity.


... TODO ...

* universe of setoids

The current formulation of SeTT is already a satisfactory (\todo{maybe not the
  right word: satisfactory to who? according to what metric?}) presentation of
the setoid model, in that it includes all the features of the semantics that we
wished to reflect in the syntax. It is also arguably expressive enough to
formalize a good chunk of set-level mathematics. However, it is also currently
lacking in a serious way, as the lack of universes seriously limits its
introspection capabilities, and consequently its strength as a foundational
system. Note that SeTT already includes a (univalent) universe of strict
propositions; hence what we are referring to is a universe of setoids.

The inclusion of a universe of setoids in SeTT poses several interesting
questions. First of all, since a universe of setoids is itself a type in SeTT,
is must also be a setoid. However, it certainly cannot be a univalent one. One
question is therefore what kind of equality to equip such universe.
%
The second question is how one can justify such universe in the setoid model.
In particular what principles, if any, should be added to the metatheory in
order to be able to define the universe.

This paper is an attempt to give an answer to the questions above.
...TODO...

\section{Setoid model}

%% The setoid interpretation gives rise to a model of a type theory with functional
%% and propositional extensionality. It is thus a way to explain extensionality in
%% a type-theoretic and computationally adequate way \cite{setoid-model}. 

By \emph{setoid model} we intend a class of models of (intensional) type theory
where contexts/closed types are interpreted as setoids, i.e. sets with an
equivalence relation, and dependent types are interpreted as dependent/indexed
setoids.
%
A setoid model was first given by M. Hofmann in \cite{hofmann-ext-int} in order
to give a semantics to extensionality principles such as functional and
propositional extensionality. Here we consider a similar model construction, due
to T. Altenkirch \cite{setoid-model}.

The peculiarity of this model is that it is presented in a type theoretic and
intensional metatheory. The metatheory is also very simple, requiring only $\Pi$
types, $\Sigma$ types, and a universe of definitionally proof-irrelevant
propositions itself closed under such type formers.
%
Notably, the use of strict prop makes this model a strict one, namely one where
every equation in the model is a definitional equality in the metatheory.  The
model itself validates the extensionality principles mentioned above, like
funext, proext, and quotient types. As a consequence, this model construction
provides a way to explain extensionality, by giving a way to implement it from
stratch in terms of a base theory that is both very simple and intensional.

This idea of implementing extensionality via this model can be made both more
precise and more practical. Indeed, the strictness of this model implies that we
can turn this model into a syntactic translation, from which a syntactic
presentation of the model can be derived. (See next section, and [cite mpc'19])
\todo{rewrite this.}

\todo{mention that everything takes place in a type theoretic metatheory, with
  strict prop etc...}

\subsection{Setoid Type Theory}

The setoid model has been recently adapted into Setoid Type Theory (SeTT), which
is justified by a syntactic translation into a very basic \emph{target theory}
\cite{mpc19}. This translation relies on the existence in the target theory of a
universe of definitionally proof-irrelevant propositions $\Prop$, as recently
implemented in Coq and Agda \cite{gilbert}. The setoid interpretation models a
universe of propositions where equality of propositions is logical equivalence,
thus providing a very basic instance of univalence.

Technically, SeTT is an extension of MLTT with extra component to support setoid
reasoning. These extra components are essentially an internalization of the idea
that every type is a setoid. More precisely, we have rules [explaining TODO]
that contexts (aka closed types) are setoids, and that dependent types are
setoids indexed over setoids.

\[
\infer{
  \GG^\sim\ \rho_0\ \rho_1 : \metaprop
}{
  \GG : \Con \qquad \subj{\rho_0, \rho_1}{\DD}{\GG}
}
\qquad
\infer{
  A^{\sim}\ \rho_{01}\ a_0\ a_1 : \Tm\ \DD\ \Prop
}{
  \deduce{
    a_0 : \Tm\ \DD\ A[\rho_0] \qquad a_1 : \Tm\ \DD\ A[\rho_1]
  }{
    A : \Ty\ \GG \qquad \rho_{01} : \GG^{\sim}\ \rho_0\ \rho_1
  }
}
\]

%% Note that the setoid equivalence relations are strict propositions.

In addition, we also have rules representing the fact that every construction in
SeTT respects setoid equality, so that we can transport along any such equality:

    \[
    \infer{
      \deduce{
        \tmj{\GD}{\coh_A\ p\ a}{\underline{A^\sim\ p\ a\ (\coe_A\ p\ a)}}
      }{
        \tmj{\GD}{\coe_A\ p\ a}{A[\rho_1]}
      }
    }{
      \tyj{\GG}{A} \qquad \subj{\rho_0, \rho_1}{\GD}{\GG} \qquad
      p : \GG^\sim\ \rho_0\ \rho_1\qquad
      \tmj{\GD}{a}{A[\rho_0]}
    }
    \]

Equality in SeTT differs from the standard approach by Martin-Loef in that every
type comes equipped with an equality relation. This is in contrast with ML's
identity type which is defined uniformly for any type.
%
Nevertheless, we can easily recover the usual ML identity type from setoid
equality:

\[
\infer{
  \textsf{Id}_A\ a_0\ a_1 :\equiv A^{\sim}\ (\R\ \GG)\ a_0\ a_1 : \Tm\ \GG\ \Prop
}{
  \tyj{\GG}{A} \qquad \tmj{\GG}{a_0, a_1}{A}
}
\]

Note that ... we have UIP... Moreover, contractibility of singletons holds by
UIP and by definition of equality on $\Sigma$ types. Therefore we can define the
$\J$ eliminator:

\[
\infer{
  \tmj{\GG}{\J_M\ p\ d}{M[a_0, a_1, p]}
}{
  \deduce{
    \tmj{\GG}{d}{M[a_0, a_0, \refl_A\ a_0]}
    \qquad
    \tmj{\GG}{p}{\underline{\Id_A\ a_0\ a_1}}
  }{
  \tyj{(\GG, x : A, y : A, p : \Id_A\ x\ y)}{M}
  }
}
\]


\section{Universe of setoids}

\todo{Mention that the universe cannot be univalent}

\todo{Maybe mention the fact that it should be possible to give an elimination
  principle for the setoid universe. This also makes sense since it's not univalent.}

As currently defined, SeTT is a system already powerful enough to support the
formalization of part of set-level mathematics. Still, we would also like to
equip SeTT with a universe of setoids. As any type in SeTT, this universe must
in turn be a setoid. However, unlike the already existing universe of
propositions, a universe of setoids cannot be univalent, as this would force it
to be a groupoid. Instead, we must define its equivalence relation so that it
only reflects a simple, syntactic equality of codes.

As we use Type Theory as our metatheory, this universe of setoids is going to be
an internal construction in Type Theory. The usual way to encode universes in
Type Theory is by an inductive-recursive definition. As we will see in Section
TODO, it is indeed possible to give a IR definition of a universe of setoids.
%
However, we would prefer not to be forced to assume inductive-recursive types,
or IR in general, in the basic type theory which is the target of the setoid
translation. This is because the point of the translation is to explain a
complex system in terms of a very simple, well understood core, and we think
introducing IR would go against this goal.

Fortunately, it is possible to reduce some instances of induction-recursion to
plain induction (more specifically, inductive families), and the well known IR
universe construction is indeed one of them.

In the next section, we recall the IR construction of universes in type theory,
as well as lay out the process by which such construction can be turned to one
that only relies on inductive families. In Section TODO, we give a first IR
definition of the universe of setoids. After that we will see if and how such IR
definition can be turned into one that does not rely on IR.

\subsection{Encoding of universes via IR and II}

A standard, well-known way of encoding universes in type theory is via induction-recursion.
\todo{a couple of words about induction recursion}.

To define a universe, we simultaneously define the universe of codes itself, as
an inductive definition, and a family $\El : \U \to \Set$ that assigns, to each
code corresponding to some type, the meta-theoretic type of its elements.

For example, the definition of a small universe with booleans and $\Pi$ types
would be the following:

\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \U\ : \Set_1 \\
  & \quad \textsf{bool} : \U \\
  & \quad \textsf{pi} : (A : \U) \to (\El\ A \to \U) \to \U \\
  & \El\ \textsf{bool} = \mathbbm{2} \\
  & \El\ (\textsf{pi}\ A\ B) = (a : \El\ A) \to \El\ (B\ a)
\end{align*}

Note that $\U$ is defined to be in $\Set_1$ rather than $\Set$. This is
because... \todo{TODO}

As it turns out, induction-recursion is not really required to encode such
a universe, although is certainly makes the definition particularly nice.
%
In fact, we know that we can translate basic instances of induction-recursion
into inductive families using the equivalence of $I$-indexed families of sets
and sets over $I$, i.e.\ $[I, \Set_i] \simeq \Set_i/I$ for $I : \Set_i$.

Following this, we seen that we can actually encode the universe above as an
inductive type $\ad{in-U}$ that \emph{carves out} all types in $\Set$ that are
in the image of $\El$. In other words, $\ad{in-U}$ is a predicate that holds for
any type that would have been obtained via $\El$ in the usual
inductive-recursive definition. As $\El$ is indexed on the type of codes, the
definition of $\ad{in-U}$ quite expectedly reflecs the inductive structure of
codes.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \ad{in-U} : \Set \to \Set_1 \\
  & \quad \textsf{inBool} : \textsf{in-U}\ \mathbbm{2} \\
  & \quad \textsf{inPi}
  :  \{A : \Set\} \{B : A \to \Set\}\\
  & \ \qquad \to \ad{in-U}\ A
  \to ((a : A) \to \ad{in-U}\ (B\ a))
  \to \ad{in-U}\ ((a : A) \to (B\ a))
\end{align*}
Using this $\U$ and $\El$ can be given as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \U & = \Sigma (A : \Set)\ (\textsf{in-U}\ A) \\
  \El & = \textsf{proj}_1
\end{align*}

Note that this construction gives rise to a universe in $\Set_1$, rather than
$\Set$, since the definition of $\U$ quantifies over all possible sets. Thus,
the meta-theory must contain at least one universe for this construction to go
through.

\subsection{A first definition of the setoid universe}

To provide such a universe we need to first define a setoid for the universe,
i.e. a set of codes together with an equivalence relation reflecting equality of
codes. That is, we need the following data
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data} \ \setoidU : \Set_1 \\
  & \_\sim_\setoidU\_ : \setoidU \to \setoidU \to \Prop_1
  %% & \El : \setoidU \to \Set \\
  %% & \_\vdash\_\sim_\El\_ : \{a\ a' : \setoidU\} \to a \sim_\setoidU a' \to \El\ a \to \El\ a' \to \Prop
\end{align*}
%
in addition to proofs that these are indeed equivalence relations
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{refl}_\setoidU : (A : \setoidU) \to \equ{A}{A} \\
  & \textsf{sym}_\setoidU : \equ{A}{B} \to \equ{B}{A} \\
  & \textsf{trans}_\setoidU : \equ{A}{B} \to \equ{B}{C} \to \equ{A}{C}
\end{align*}

Moreover, we need a way to reflect codes into types. Thus, we define a family of
setoids indexed over the universe. This is given by the data below, that
together assign to each code in the universe a carrier set and an equivalence
relation.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \El : \setoidU \to \Set \\
  & \_\vdash\_\sim_\El\_ : \{a\ a' : \setoidU\} \to a \sim_\setoidU a' \to \El\ a \to \El\ a' \to \Prop
\end{align*}

Note that $\eqel{}{}{}$ is indexed over equality on the universe, because $\El$
is a setoid morphism, hence in particular it must respect the setoid equality of
$\setoidU$.
%
We also require data and proofs that make sure we get setoids out of $\El$:

\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{refl}_\El : (A : \setoidU) (x : \El\ A) \to \eqel{\reflu\ A}{x}{x} \\
  & \textsf{sym}_\El : \eqel{p}{x}{x'} \to \eqel{\symu\ p}{x'}{x} \\
  & \textsf{trans}_\El : \eqel{p}{x}{x'} \to \eqel{q}{x'}{x''} \to \eqel{\transu\ p\ q}{x}{x''} \\
  & \coeel : \equ{A}{B} \to \El\ A \to \El\ B \\
  & \cohel : (p : \equ{A}{A'}) \ (x : \El\ A) \to \eqel{p}{x}{\coeel\ p\ x}
\end{align*}

\todo{QIIT II LICS paper. this part is already in the HIIT paper}

We given an inductive definition of $\setoidU$, mutually with a recursive
definition of everything else.

\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \setoidU : \Set_1 \\
  & \quad \textsf{bool} : \setoidU \\
  %% Πs : (a : U i)(b : El a → U i)
     %% (refb : {x x' : El a}(x~ : refU a ⊢ x ~El x') → b x ~U b x') → U i
  & \quad \textsf{pi}
  :  (A : \setoidU) (B : \El\ A \to \setoidU)\\
  & \ \qquad \to (\{x\ x' : \El\ A\} \to \textsf{refl}_\setoidU\ A \vdash x \sim_\El x' \to B\ x \sim_\setoidU B\ x')
  \to \setoidU
\end{align*}

Note that in the definition of $\setoidU$, we crucially require that the family
$B : \El\ A \to \setoidU$ be a setoid morphism, hence that it respects the
corresponding setoid equalities.

An example of this is in the definition of $\El$:

\begin{align*}
  & \El\ \textsf{bool} :\equiv ? \\
  & \El\ (\textsf{pi}\ A\ B\ h) :\equiv \\
  & \qquad \Sigma\ (f : (a : \El\ A) \to \El\ (B\ a)) \\
  & \qquad \quad
  (\forall\{x\ x'\}(p : \eqel{\reflu\ A}{x}{x'}) \to \eqel{h\ p}{f\ x}{f\ x'})
\end{align*}

We define a $\Pi$ type to be the set of functions that map equal elements to
equal results. However, to state the latter property we need to compare elements
in different types, coming from applying $f$ to different arguments $x$ and
$x'$.  We know that $x$ and $x'$ are equal, but to conclude $\equ{B\ x}{B\ x'}$
we need to know that $B$ respects setoid equality. This is exactly what we get
from our definition of $\setoidU$.

This definition of the setoid universe relies on both induction-recursion and
induction-induction. Although appily accepted by Agda, the meaning of this
combination is not really understood. The goal of the next sections is therefore
to find an alternative definition of the setoid universe that relies on
principles that are better understood. Not only that, we would like to reduce
the number of extensions to the metatheory that are needed to be able to give
such definition, so to stay as close as possible to our initial idea of reducing
SeTT to a small core.  \todo{reword}

The next section explains our main result, which is that a modified form of the
translation of IR to IF also works for the setoid universe defined above. This
type is more complex that the basic IR types we have seen before, in that it
uses a combination of IR and II, and includes the universe of strict
propositions.

\subsection{Inductive-inductive universe}

The reduction of the IIR universe to induction works, conceptually, as before.
%
However, in addition to $\ad{in-U}$ for defining $\U$, we also introduce a
family $\ad{in-U∼}$ of binary relations between types in the universe, from
which we then define $\_\sim_{\setoidU}\_$.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \ad{in-U} : \Set \to \Set_1 \\
  & \textsf{data}\ \ad{in-U∼} : \{A\ A' : \Set\} \to \ad{in-U}\ A \to \ad{in-U}\ A' \to (A \to A' \to \Prop) \to \Set_1
\end{align*}

Note that $\ad{in-U}$ appears in the sort of $\ad{in-U∼}$, thus making this
definition as instance of induction-induction [cite]. \todo{add brief
  explanation of induction-induction}.

As in the previous example, we can now define $\setoidU$ as a $\Sigma$ type, and
$\El$ as the corresponding first projection.

\begin{align*}
  & \setoidU : \Set_1 \\
  & \setoidU = \Sigma\ (X : \Set)\ (\ad{in-U}\ X) \\
  & \El : \setoidU \to \Set \\
  & \El = \textsf{proj}_1
\end{align*}

What is left now is to define the setoid equality relation on the universe, as
well as the setoid equality relation on $\El\ A$ for any $A$ in $\setoidU$.
%
The definition of $\_\sim_{\setoidU}\_$ follows, in principle, that of
$\setoidU$. A ...

Similarly, two codes $A, B$ in the universe $\setoidU$ are equal when there
exists a setoid equivalence relation on their respective sets $\El\ A$ and $\El
B$. Intuitively, since elements of a setoid are only ever compared to elements
of the same setoid, this is only possible if $A, B$ are codes for the same
setoid, that is, if $A \sim_{\setoidU} B$. Existence and well-formedness of such
relations is expressed via the type $\ad{in-U~}$ just defined, hence formally we
should have something like:

\[
A \sim_{\setoidU} B :\equiv \Sigma (R: ...) ...
\]

or, using pattern matching:

\[
(A, p) \sim_{\setoidU} (A', p') :\equiv \Sigma (R: ...) ...
\]

Unfortunately this definition only captures the idea we are aiming for, but does
not actually typecheck. In fact, $\_\sim_{\setoidU}\_$ is a $\Prop_1$-valued
relation, so $A \sim_{\setoidU} B$ should be a proposition, but $\Sigma (R: ...)
...$ clearly isn't.

The solution is actually quite simple, and it just involves truncating the
$\Sigma$ type described above to force it to be in $\Prop_1$. More precisely, we
assume to have in our metatheory, in addition to a hierarchy of universes of
strict propositions $\Prop_i$, a truncation operation $\parallel\_\parallel :
\Set_i \to \Prop_i$ with constructor $|\_| : \{A : \Set_i\} \to A \to \parallel
A \parallel$ and eliminator $\ad{withTrunc} : \{B : \Prop_i\} \to (A \to B) \to
\parallel A \parallel \to B$. Note that truncation can be defined in Agda
extended with the universe of strict propositions, with the eliminator replaced
by pattern matching.

\begin{align*}
  & \_\sim_{\setoidU}\_ : \setoidU \to \setoidU \to \Prop_1 \\
  & (X , p) \sim_{\setoidU} (X' , p') =
   \ \parallel \Sigma\ (R : X \to X' \to \Prop)\ (\ad{in-U∼}\ p\ p'\ R) \parallel
\end{align*}

This trick might seem to simple to the point of being naive, but as we will see
it is sufficient to make the entire definition go through.

We are now left to define $\_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_$.

\begin{align*}
  & \_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_ : \{a\ a' : \U\} \to a\ \sim_{\setoidU}\ a' \to \El\ a \to \El\ a' \to \Prop
\end{align*}


Intuition would suggest to define $\_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_$ by projecting
the relation out of the proof of $A \sim_{\setoidU} A'$, in much the same way as
$\El$ is defined by projecting out of $\U$. That is, $p \vdash x \sim_{\El} y =
\ad{proj}_1\ p\ x\ y$.
%
However, this doesn't work since the type of $p$ is propositionally truncated,
hence it cannot be used to construct a proof-relevant object. In other words,
the proof $p$ cannot be eliminated into $El A \to El A' \to Prop$, because
$El A \to El A' \to Prop$ is not a proposition, but a $\Set$.

We can work around this limitation by defining $p \vdash x \sim_{\El} y$ by
induction on the codes $a\ a' : \setoidU$, in a way that is logically equivalent
to the proposition we would have obtained by $\ad{proj}_1\ p\ x\ y$ if that
expression was well-typed.

Note that for this definition to go through, we sometimes need the fact that the
relation we are building is indeed equivalent to the one we would have obtained
if we could project out of the truncation. That is, we need an additional proof
that for any concrete $R$ and $\ad{inR}$, $| (R, \ad{inR}) | \vdash x \sim_{\El}
y \iff R\ x\ y$. We thus need to define $\_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_$ mutually with a proof
of the following

We know that finitary inductive-inductive definitions can be translated into
inductive families \cite{iit-erasure,iit-to-ix,induction-is-enough} but it is
not clear whether this construction extends to an infinitary type like the one
above. This is subject of further work. If successful we would be able to give a
translation of the setoid model with a universe into a very basic core type
theory.
