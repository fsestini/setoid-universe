\section{Introduction}

A central aspect of Type Theory is the coexistence of two notions of
equality. On the one hand definitional equality, the computational equality that
is built into the formalism. On the other hand propositional equality, the
internal notion of equality that is actually used to state and prove equational
theorems within the system. The precise balance between these two notions is at
the center of type theory research; however, it is generally understood that to
properly support formalization of mathematics in type theory, one should aim for
a definitional equality that is decidable and therefore machine-checkable, and a
notion of propositional equality that is as extensional as possible.

Two extensionality principles seem particularly desirable, in that they arguably
constitute the bare minimum for type theory to be comparable to set theory as a
foundational system for set-level mathematics, in terms of power and ergonomics.
One is function extensionality, according to which functions are equal if
point-wise equal. Another is propositional extensionality, equating all
propositions that are logically equivalent.

Extensional Type Theory (ETT) does support extensional reasoning to some degree,
thus seemingly being a convenient setting for formalization of
mathematics. However, equality reflection makes type-checking ETT terms
computationally unfeasible, if not impossible.

On the other hand, Intensional Type Theory has nice computational properties
that can make it more suitable for computer implementation, but as normally
defined [cite ML paper?] it lacks the amount of extensionality necessary to
effectively \emph{use} it.
%
It is known from model constructions that extensional principles like function
extensionality (funext) are consistent with ITT.
%
Moreover, ITT extended with uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) and funext is
known to be as powerful as ETT [cite hofmann]. These principles can be added as
axioms, however destroying some computational properties of ITT such as
canonicity.

Ultimately, what is needed is a formulation of ITT that supports the
aforementioned extensionality principles, while retaining convenient
computational properties like canonicity.
%
Unfortunately, one can show that whenever identity types are defined according
to Martin-Loef's inductive definition, there is no hope to have canonicity and
funext coexist.
%
The first step towards a solution is to give up the idea of equality as a single
inductive definition. Instead, equality should be defined specifically for each
type former in the type theory. According to this principle, funext can be
justified by simply defining equality on function types to be point-wise
equality.

%% * One possible answer: setoids

Sets, or types, together with a propositional equivalence relation as their
notion of equality are known as \emph{setoids}. There are several definitions of
the setoid model of Type Theory, the first of which was constructed to show
consistency of funext for ITT [cite]. This consistency result is implied by the
observation that UIP and funext hold in the setoid model. Moreover, it was shown
by Altenkirch [cite] that is the model construction is carried out in a
metatheory with a universe of strict (definitionally proof-irrelevant)
propositions, it is possible to define a univalent universe of propositions,
therefore satisfying propositional extensionality. The setoid model thus
satisfies all the extensionality principles that we would like to extend ITT
with. The question is whether there exists a version of ITT that supports setoid
reasoning, and hence the forms of extensionality enables by it.

This question was revisited and answered in Altenkirch et al. [cite]. In this
paper, the authors define SeTT an extension of intensional MLTT + Prop with
constructs for setoid reasoning, where funext and propext hold by
definition. Moreover, they justify SeTT via a syntactic translation, after
observing that this is made possible by the strictness of the model (every
equation holds definitionally). This is in contrast with other type theories
based on the setoid model, like OTT [cite] and XTT [cite], which instead rely on
ETT as metatheory for their justification. A major contribution of SeTT is
therefore to provide a way to bootstrap extensionality, by translating it into a
small core intensional theory by means that do not require extensionality to
begin with.

The current formulation of SeTT is already a rich theory. However, its
introspection capabilities are currently lacking, as they are limited to the
univalent universe of propositions. We would like to internalise the notion of
type in SeTT, thus extending the theory with a universe of setoids.
%
This brings up several questions, one of which has to do with the notion of
equality with which the universe should come equipped. The universe of setoids
is itself a setoid (as any type is), so it certainly cannot be a univalent
universe, since a univalent setoid would be a groupoid rather than a setoid.
%
Another question asks how one can justify such universe in the setoid model. In
particular what principles, are needed from the metatheory in order to define
the universe.

\paragraph{Contributions}

This paper documents our work towards the construction of a universe of setoids
inside the setoid model, and tries to answer these and other questions related
to the design and implementation of this construction. Our main contribution is
the definition of the universe in the setoid model; this is initially given as
an inductive-inductive-recursive definition, which is then translated firstly to
an inductive-inductive definition, and secondly to a purely inductive type. As a
consequence, we show that we only need to assume indexed W-types in the
metatheory (along with some obligatory basic tools like $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$
types) to justify the universe.

\paragraph{Structure of the paper}

In Section~\label{sec:metatheory}...

\section{$MLTT^{Prop}$}\label{metatheory}

This section describes $MLTT^{Prop}$, the metatheory in which we model
construction takes place. It is crucial to keep the metatheory as minimal as
possible.

$MLTT^{Prop}$ is an intensional MLTT with $\Pi, \Sigma, \textsf{Bool},
\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1}$, and a universe of strict propositions $\mProp$. We also
have definitional $\eta$ rules for $\Pi, \Sigma$, and $\mathbf{1}$
types. Propositions can be lifted to types via $\textsf{Lift} : \mProp \to
\mType$. The universe of propositions is inhabited by false $\bot$ and
propositional truncation $\|\_\| : \mType \to \mProp$. We also require indexed
W-types, both in $\mType$ and $\mProp$:

\begin{align*}
  W & : (S : \mType) \to (S \to \mType) \to \mType \\
  W_p & : (S : \mType) \to (S \to \mType) \to \mProp
\end{align*}

We also require the propositional versions of $\mathbf{1}$, $\Pi$, and $\Sigma$,
however these can be defined from their $\mType$ counterparts via truncation:

\begin{align*}
  \Pi_p\ P\ Q & :\equiv \| \Pi\ (\textsf{Lift} \ P)\ (\textsf{Lift} \circ Q \circ \textsf{unlift}) \| \\
  \Sigma_P\ P\ Q & :\equiv \| \Sigma\ (\textsf{Lift} \ P)\ (\textsf{Lift} \circ Q \circ \textsf{unlift}) \| \\
  \mathbf{1}_p & :\equiv \| \mathbf{1} \|
\end{align*}

Note that a universe of strict propositions has been recently added to the Agda
proof assistant [cite], thus making $MLTT^{Prop}$ a subset of Agda. In fact,
most of the developments presented here have been formalized and proof-checked
using Agda extended with strict propositions. For convenience we will employ
Agda notation for metatheoretic constructions throughout the paper, with the
implication that these can be understood as, or easily translated to, equivalent
$MLTT^{Prop}$ definitions.

\section{Setoid model}

%% The setoid interpretation gives rise to a model of a type theory with functional
%% and propositional extensionality. It is thus a way to explain extensionality in
%% a type-theoretic and computationally adequate way \cite{setoid-model}. 

By \emph{setoid model} we intend a class of models of (intensional) type theory
where contexts/closed types are interpreted as setoids, i.e. sets with an
equivalence relation, and dependent types are interpreted as dependent/indexed
setoids.
%
A setoid model was first given by M. Hofmann in \cite{hofmann-ext-int} in order
to give a semantics to extensionality principles such as functional and
propositional extensionality. Here we consider a similar model construction, due
to T. Altenkirch \cite{setoid-model}.
%
The peculiarity of this model is that it is presented in a type theoretic and
intensional metatheory, in our case $MLTT^{Prop}$.
%
The use of strict propositions to define the setoid equivalence relations makes
this model \emph{strict}. A strict model is one where every equation holds
definitionally. The setoid model thus defined validates extensionality
principles like funext, proext, and quotient types. As a consequence, it
provides a way to bootstrap and explain extensionality by implementing it in a
core intensional type theory.

As any model of Type Theory, the setoid model can be framed categorically as a
category with families (CwF) with extra structure for the various type and term
formers. The core structure can be defined as the following signature:

\begin{align*}
  \Con &: \mType \\
  \Ty &: (\GG : \Con) \to \mType \\
  \Sub &: (\GG \GD : \Con) \to \mType \\
  \Tm &: (\GG : \Con) \to \Ty\ \GG \to \mType
\end{align*}

Contexts are given by setoids, that is types together with an equivalence relation.

\[
\infer{
  \begin{aligned}
    & | \GG | : \mType \\
    & \GG^\sim : | \GG | \to | \GG | \to \mProp \\
    & ...
  \end{aligned}
}{
  \GG : \Con
}
\]

Types in a context $\GG$ are given by setoid morphisms from $\GG$ to the
(strict) category of setoids. The definition can be unfolded as follows:

\[
\infer{
  \begin{aligned}
    & | A | : | \GG | \to \mType \\
    & A^\sim : \{\gamma_0\ \gamma_1 : | \GG |\}
    \to | A | \gamma_0 \to | A | \gamma_1 \to \mProp \\
    & \textsf{coe} : \{\gamma_0\ \gamma_1 : | \GG |\} \to \GG^\sim\ \gamma_0\ \gamma_1 \to | A | \gamma_0 \to | A | \gamma_1 \\
    & \dots
  \end{aligned}
}{
  A : \Ty\ \GG
}
\]

This definition of types in the setoid model is different from the original one
in [cite LICS 99 paper], but it is equivalent to it [cite].
%
Substitutions are interpreted as functors between the corresponding setoids,
whereas terms of type $A$ in context $\GG$ are sections of the type seen as a
fibration $\GG . A \to \GG$. Note that we only need to include components for
the functorial action on objects and morphisms, since the functor laws follow
from proof-irrelevance.

\[
\infer{
  \begin{aligned}
    & | \sigma | : | \GG | \to | \GD | \\
    & \sigma^\sim : \forall\{\rho_0\, \rho_1\} \to \GG^\sim\, \rho_0\, \rho_1 \to \GD^\sim\, (|\sigma|\rho_0)\, (|\sigma|\rho_1)
  \end{aligned}
}{
  \sigma : \Sub\ \GG\ \GD
}
\]

\[
\infer{
  \begin{aligned}
    & | t | : (\gamma : | \GG |) \to | A | \, \gamma \\
    & t^\sim : ...
  \end{aligned}
}{
  t : \Tm\ \GG\ A
}
\]

As defined, we can show that the setoid model validates the usual basic type
formers ($\Pi, \Sigma$, etc.), including function extensionality and a universe
of strict propositions satisfying propositional extensionality [cite LICS
  99]. Note that we don't need neither identity types nor inductive types
(W-types) in the metatheory to achieve this. However, W-types are needed when
constructing the setoid universe in the next sections.

\subsection{Setoid Type Theory}

The setoid model presented in the previous section is peculiar in several
ways. One is that it can be presented in a very small type theoretic
metatheory. The other important aspect is that it is \emph{strict}, namely every
equation of the original syntax holds by definition in the semantics. One
advantage of strict models is that they can be turned into \emph{syntactic
  translations}, in which syntactic objects of the source theory are interpreted
as their counterparts in another \emph{target} theory. In the case of the setoid
model, this gives rise to a \emph{setoid translation}, where source contexts are
interpreted as target contexts together with a target type representing the
equivalence relation, and so on.

A setoid translation is used in \cite{mpc19} to justify Setoid Type Theory
(SeTT), an extension of $MLTT^{Prop}$ (without W-types) with equality types for
contexts and dependent types that reflect the setoid equality of the model in
the syntax.

We recall the rules of SeTT that extend $MLTT^{Prop}$ below, but with a
variation. Whereas the equality types in \cite{mpc19} are stated as elements of
the universe of propositions internal to SeTT itself, we here state the context
equalities as elements of the external, metatheoretic universe
$\mProp$. Equality on dependent types is defined as before.

We have a universe of propositions $\Prop$ defined as follows:

\[
\infer{
  \Prop : \Ty\ \GG
}{
  \GG : \Con
}
\qquad
\infer{
  \underline{P} : \Ty\ \GG
}{
  P : \Tm\ \GG\ \Prop
}
\]

Equality type constructors for contexts and dependent types internalize the idea
that every context and type comes equipped with a setoid equivalence
relation. As in the model, equality for dependent types is indexed over context
equality.

\[
\infer{
  \GG^\sim\ \rho_0\ \rho_1 : \metaprop
}{
  \GG : \Con \qquad \subj{\rho_0, \rho_1}{\DD}{\GG}
}
\qquad
\infer{
  A^{\sim}\ \rho_{01}\ a_0\ a_1 : \Tm\ \DD\ \Prop
}{
  \deduce{
    a_0 : \Tm\ \DD\ A[\rho_0] \qquad a_1 : \Tm\ \DD\ A[\rho_1]
  }{
    A : \Ty\ \GG \qquad \rho_{01} : \GG^{\sim}\ \rho_0\ \rho_1
  }
}
\]

We have rules witnessing that these are indeed equivalence relations. We only
recall reflexivity:

\[
\infer{
  \textsf{R}\ \rho : \GG^\sim\ \rho\ \rho
}{
  \rho : \Sub\ \GD\ \GG
}
\qquad
\infer{
  \textsf{R}\ a : \Tm\ \GG\ \underline{A^\sim\ (\textsf{R}\ \rho)\ a\ a}
}{
  A : \Ty\ \GG
  \qquad
  \rho : \Sub\ \GD\ \GG
  \qquad
  a : \Tm\ \GD\ A[\rho]
}
\]

In addition, we also have rules representing the fact that every construction in
SeTT respects setoid equality, so that we can transport along any such equality:

    \[
    \infer{
      \deduce{
        \tmj{\GD}{\coh_A\ p\ a}{\underline{A^\sim\ p\ a\ (\coe_A\ p\ a)}}
      }{
        \tmj{\GD}{\coe_A\ p\ a}{A[\rho_1]}
      }
    }{
      \tyj{\GG}{A} \qquad \subj{\rho_0, \rho_1}{\GD}{\GG} \qquad
      p : \GG^\sim\ \rho_0\ \rho_1\qquad
      \tmj{\GD}{a}{A[\rho_0]}
    }
    \]

Notably, equality constructors in SeTT compute definitionally on concrete type
formers. In particular, they compute to their obvious intended meaning, so that
an equality of pairs is a pair of equalities, an equality of functions is a map
of equalities, and so on. From this, we get definitional versions of function
and propositional extensionality.
%
\begin{align*}
  & (\Pi\ A\ B)^\sim\ p\ f_0\ f_1 = ... \\
  & (\Sigma\ A\ B)^\sim\ p\ (a_0, b_0)\ (a_1, b_1) = ... \\
  & \Prop^\sim\ p\ P\ Q = ...
\end{align*}

We can easily recover the usual Martin-L\"of identity type from setoid equality,
with transport implemented via coercion.

\[
\infer{
  \textsf{Id}_A\ a_0\ a_1 :\equiv A^{\sim}\ (\R\ \GG)\ a_0\ a_1 : \Tm\ \GG\ \Prop
}{
  \tyj{\GG}{A} \qquad \tmj{\GG}{a_0, a_1}{A}
}
\]
\[
\infer{
  \textsf{transp}\ P\ p\ t :\equiv
    \coe\ P\ (\textsf{R}\ \textsf{id} , p)\ t : \Tm\ \GG\ P[a_1]
}{
  P : \Ty\ (\GG . A)
  \qquad
  p : \Tm\ \GG\ (\Id\ A\ a_0\ a_1)
  \qquad
  t : \Tm\ \GG\ P[a_0]
}
\]

Note that contractibility of singletons holds in SeTT by UIP and the computation
rules of equality on $\Sigma$ types. Hence, the J eliminator can also be
derived.

\section{Universe of setoids}

In its current form, SeTT is already rich and interesting in its own right.
However, as pointed out in the introduction, it is also seriously limited by the
lack of a universe internalizing the notion of types beyond propositions, that
is, a universe of setoids. Our goal is to extend SeTT with such universe; since
SeTT is a direct syntactic reflection of the setoid model, this essentially
amounts to showing that a universe of setoids with the necessary structure and
equations can be constructed within the setoid model. This opens several
questions and possible design choices.

A first fundamental consideration has to with the very definition of the setoid
universe: as any type in the setoid model, this universe must be a setoid and
thus come equipped with an equivalence relation. However, unlike the already
existing universe of propositions, a universe of setoids cannot be univalent,
since this would force it to be a groupoid. Instead, we can define the relation
so that it reflects a simpler syntactic equality of codes.

Another question has to do with the metatheoretic tools required to carry out
the construction of the universe. In fact, one of the main aspects of the setoid
model construction recalled in Section TODO and shown originally in [cite LICS
  99] is that it can be carried out in a very small type theoretic metatheory,
thus providing a way to reduce extensionality to a small intensional core.
%
In extending the setoid model with a universe, we would like this property to
still hold, hence it is of primary concern to reduce to a minimum the extensions
required in the metatheory, so to keep it as small as possible.

A known and established method for constructing universes in Type Theory uses
induction-recursion (IR), a definition schema developed by Dybjer
[cite]. Inductive-recursive definitions can be found throughout the literature
on type theory, from the already mentioned type theoretic universes, including
the original formulation a la Tarski by Martin-L\"of [cite], to metamathematical
tools like computability predicates [cite].

Although universe constructions in Type Theory---including our own setoid
universe---are naturally presented as inductive-recursive definitions, they
may not necessarily require a metatheory that supports induction-recursion. In
fact, it is possible to reduce some instances of induction-recursion to plain
induction (more specifically, inductive families), including some universe
definitions. We recall this reduction in Section TODO.

%% However, we would prefer not to be forced to assume inductive-recursive types,
%% or IR in general, in the basic type theory which is the target of the setoid
%% translation. This is because the point of the translation is to explain a
%% complex system in terms of a very simple, well understood core, and we think
%% introducing IR would go against this goal.

Other design choices on the setoid universe are less essential, but still
require careful consideration. For instance, one question is whether the setoid
universe should support elimination, thus exposing the inductive structure of
the codes. Universe elimination is known to be inconsistent with univalence. As
it turns our, univalence is not an issue in our case; nevertheless it is not
immediately clear if the elimination principle can be justified by the
semantics.

Another choice is whether to include codes for other universes, besides the
usual type formers. One could have $\Prop$ be a code in the setoid universe,
rather than a type. Moreover, the universes could form a hierarchy, where the
universe at level $i$ is an element of the universe of level $i+1$. Another
option is whether to make the hierarchy cumulative.

%% In the next section, we recall the inductive-recursive construction of universes
%% in type theory, as well as lay out the process by which such construction can be
%% turned to one that only relies on inductive families. In Section TODO, we give a
%% first inductive-recursive definition of the universe of setoids. After that we
%% will see if and how such IR definition can be turned into one that does not rely
%% on IR.

\subsection{Encoding of universes via IR and II}

An inductive-recursive universe is given by a type of codes $\U$, and a family
$\El : \U \to \mType$ that assigns, to each code corresponding to some type, the
meta-theoretic type of its elements. The resulting definition is
inductive-recursive because the inductive type of codes is defined
simultaneously with the recursive function $\El$.

As an example, consider the following definition of a small universe with
booleans and $\Pi$ types.

\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \U\ : \mType_1 \\
  & \quad \textsf{bool} : \U \\
  & \quad \textsf{pi} : (A : \U) \to (\El\ A \to \U) \to \U \\
  & \El\ \textsf{bool} = \mathbbm{2} \\
  & \El\ (\textsf{pi}\ A\ B) = (a : \El\ A) \to \El\ (B\ a)
\end{align*}

Note that $\U$ is defined to be in $\mType_1$ rather than $\mType$. This is
because... \todo{TODO add explanation}. This fact also implies that the
meta-theory must contain at least one universe.

Induction-recursion is arguably the nicest and more natural way to define
internal universes in Type Theory, however it is not always required.
%
We can translate basic instances of induction-recursion into inductive families
using the equivalence of $I$-indexed families of sets and sets over $I$,
i.e.\ $[I, \mType_i] \simeq \mType_i/I$ for $I : \mType_i$.

Following this, we seen that we can actually encode the universe above as an
inductive type $\ad{in-U}$ that \emph{carves out} all types in $\Set$ that are
in the image of $\El$. In other words, $\ad{in-U}$ is a predicate that holds for
any type that would have been obtained via $\El$ in the usual
inductive-recursive definition. As $\El$ is indexed on the type of codes, the
definition of $\ad{in-U}$ quite expectedly reflecs the inductive structure of
codes.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \ad{in-U} : \mType \to \mType_1 \\
  & \quad \textsf{inBool} : \textsf{in-U}\ \mathbbm{2} \\
  & \quad \textsf{inPi}
  :  \{A : \mType\} \{B : A \to \mType\}\\
  & \ \qquad \to \ad{in-U}\ A
  \to ((a : A) \to \ad{in-U}\ (B\ a))
  \to \ad{in-U}\ ((a : A) \to (B\ a))
\end{align*}
Using this $\U$ and $\El$ can be given as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \U & = \Sigma (A : \mType)\ (\textsf{in-U}\ A) \\
  \El & = \textsf{proj}_1
\end{align*}

Note that this construction gives rise to a universe in $\mType_1$, rather than
$\Set$, since the definition of $\U$ quantifies over all possible sets.

\subsection{A first definition of the setoid universe}

In this section we give a first definition of the setoid universe, as a direct
generalization of the simple inductive-recursive definition just shown. We only
consider a very small universe with unit type $\mathds{1}$ and $\Pi$ for
simplicity; a more realistic universe can be found in the Agda formalization,
and includes more type formers.

To construct the universe of setoids in the setoid model, we first of all need
to define a type $\Uty : \Ty\ \GG$ for every $\GG : \Con$, and for every $A :
\Tm\ \GG\ \Uty$ a type $\mathds{E}l\ A : \Ty\ \GG$. Recalling Section TODO,
these are essentially record types made of several Since. components $\Uty$ is a
closed type, it requires the same data of a setoid; in particular, we need a set
of codes together with an equivalence relation reflecting equality of codes
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data} \ \setoidU : \mType_1 \\

To define $\EL$, we need a family of setoids indexed over the universe. In other
words, a way to assign to each code in the universe a carrier set and an
equivalence relation.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \El : \setoidU \to \Set \\
  & \_\vdash\_\sim_\El\_ : \{a\ a' : \setoidU\} \to a \sim_\setoidU a' \to \El\ a \to \El\ a' \to \Prop
\end{align*}

Note that $\eqel{}{}{}$ is indexed over equality on the universe, because $\El$
is a setoid morphism, hence in particular it must respect the setoid equality of
$\setoidU$.
%
We also require data and proofs that make sure we get setoids out of $\El$:

\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{refl}_\El : (A : \setoidU) (x : \El\ A) \to \eqel{\reflu\ A}{x}{x} \\
  & \textsf{sym}_\El : \eqel{p}{x}{x'} \to \eqel{\symu\ p}{x'}{x} \\
  & \textsf{trans}_\El : \eqel{p}{x}{x'} \to \eqel{q}{x'}{x''} \to \eqel{\transu\ p\ q}{x}{x''} \\
  & \coeel : \equ{A}{B} \to \El\ A \to \El\ B \\
  & \cohel : (p : \equ{A}{A'}) \ (x : \El\ A) \to \eqel{p}{x}{\coeel\ p\ x}
\end{align*}

%% \todo{QIIT II LICS paper. this part is already in the HIIT paper}

We give an inductive definition of $\setoidU$, mutually with a recursive
definition of everything else. Below we only show the more interesting definitions of $\setoidU$ and $\El$:
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \setoidU : \Set_1 \\
  & \quad \textsf{one} : \setoidU \\
  %% Πs : (a : U i)(b : El a → U i)
     %% (refb : {x x' : El a}(x~ : refU a ⊢ x ~El x') → b x ~U b x') → U i
  & \quad \textsf{pi}
  :  (A : \setoidU) (B : \El\ A \to \setoidU)\\
  & \ \qquad \to (\{x\ x' : \El\ A\} \to \textsf{refl}_\setoidU\ A \vdash x \sim_\El x' \to B\ x \sim_\setoidU B\ x')
  \to \setoidU
\end{align*}
%
\begin{align*}
  & \El\ \textsf{one} :\equiv \textbf{1} \\
  & \El\ (\textsf{pi}\ A\ B\ h) :\equiv \\
  & \qquad \Sigma\ (f : (a : \El\ A) \to \El\ (B\ a)) \\
  & \qquad \quad
  (\forall\{x\ x'\}(p : \eqel{\reflu\ A}{x}{x'}) \to \eqel{h\ p}{f\ x}{f\ x'})
\end{align*}

Note that in the definition of $\setoidU$ we require that the family $B : \El\ A
\to \setoidU$ be a setoid morphism, respecting the setoid equalities involved.
%
This choice is crucial for the definition of $\El$ to go through, in particular
since we eliminate the code for $\Pi$ types into the setoid of functions that
map equal elements to equal results. To state this mapping property we need to
compare elements in different types, coming from applying $f$ to different
arguments $x$ and $x'$. We know that $x$ and $x'$ are equal, but to conclude
$\equ{B\ x}{B\ x'}$ we need to know that $B$ respects setoid equality. This is
exactly what we get from our definition of $\setoidU$.

\todo{why is this inductive-inductive-recursive?}

%% The above definition of the setoid universe relies on both induction-recursion
%% and induction-induction. Although happily accepted by Agda, we don't fully
%% understand the meaning of this combination, so we would like to find an
%% equivalent definition that does not rely on it. The goal of the next sections is
%% therefore to get to such an alternative definition. This is done by first
%% transforming the inductive-inductive-recursive definition to one that doesn't
%% use induction-recursion, and secondly by reducing the induction-induction to
%% inductive families.

%% Our transformation of the inductive-inductive-recursive definition is inspired
%% by the well-known trick described in Section X, but modified in a novel way to
%% account for the presence of induction-induction and $\mProp$-valued types. To
%% our knowledge, this is the first time this reduction trick is applied to an
%% inductive-recursive type of this complexity.

\subsection{Inductive-inductive universe}

The reduction of the IIR universe to induction works, conceptually, as before.
%
However, in addition to $\ad{in-U}$ for defining $\U$, we also introduce a
family $\ad{in-U∼}$ of binary relations between types in the universe, from
which we then define $\_\sim_{\setoidU}\_$.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \textsf{data}\ \ad{in-U} : \Set \to \Set_1 \\
  & \textsf{data}\ \ad{in-U∼} : \{A\ A' : \Set\} \to \ad{in-U}\ A \to \ad{in-U}\ A' \to (A \to A' \to \Prop) \to \Set_1
\end{align*}

Note that $\ad{in-U}$ appears in the sort of $\ad{in-U∼}$. This is an instance
of \emph{induction-induction}, a schema that allows the definition of a type
mutually with other types that contain the first one in their signature [cit].

As in the universe example in Section TODO, we now define $\setoidU$ as a
$\Sigma$ type, and $\El$ as the corresponding first projection.

\begin{align*}
  & \setoidU : \mType_1 \\
  & \setoidU = \Sigma\ (X : \mType)\ (\ad{in-U}\ X) \\
  & \El : \setoidU \to \mType \\
  & \El = \textsf{proj}_1
\end{align*}

What is left now is to define the setoid equality relation on the universe, as
well as the setoid equality relation on $\El\ A$ for any $A$ in $\setoidU$.
%
Two codes $A, B$ in the universe $\setoidU$ are equal when there exists a setoid
equivalence relation on their respective sets $\El\ A$ and $\El B$. Intuitively,
since elements of a setoid are only ever compared to elements of the same
setoid, this should only be possible if $A, B$ are codes for the same setoid,
that is, if $A \sim_{\setoidU} B$. Existence and well-formedness of such
relations is expressed via the type $\ad{in-U~}$ just defined, hence we would
expect $A \sim_{\setoidU} B$ to be defined as follows:

\[
A \sim_{\setoidU} B :\equiv \Sigma (R: \El\,A \to \El\,B \to \mProp)(\ad{in-U∼}\ (\pi_2\,A)\ (\pi_2\,B)\ R)
\]

or, using pattern matching:

\[
(A, p_A) \sim_{\setoidU} (B, p_B) :\equiv \Sigma (R: A \to B \to \mProp)(\ad{in-U∼}\ p_A\ p_B\ R)
\]

Unfortunately this definition only manages to capture the idea, but does not
actually typecheck. In fact, $\_\sim_{\setoidU}\_$ should be $\Prop_1$-valued
relation, so $A \sim_{\setoidU} B$ should be a proposition. However, the
$\Sigma$ type shown above clearly isn't, since it quantifies over a type of
relations, which is not a proposition.
%
One possible solution is actually quite simple, and it just involves truncating
the $\Sigma$ type above to force it to be in $\Prop_1$.
%
\begin{align*}
  & \_\sim_{\setoidU}\_ : \setoidU \to \setoidU \to \Prop_1 \\
  & (X , p) \sim_{\setoidU} (X' , p') =
   \ \parallel \Sigma\ (R : X \to X' \to \Prop)\ (\ad{in-U∼}\ p\ p'\ R) \parallel
\end{align*}

We are now left to define the indexed equivalence relation on $\El$:
%
\begin{align*}
  & \_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_ : \{A\ B : \U\} \to A\ \sim_{\setoidU}\ B \to \El\ A \to \El\ B \to \mProp \\
  & p \vdash a \sim_{\El} b :\equiv \ ?
\end{align*}

In the definition above, $p$ has type $\|| \Sigma (R: \El\,A \to \El\,B \to
\mProp)(...) \||$. If the type wasn't propositionally truncated, we could define
$p \vdash a \sim_{\El} b$ by extracting the relation out of the first component
of $p$, and apply it to $a, b$. That is, $p \vdash a \sim_{\El} b :\equiv
\pi_1\,p\,a\,b$. This would make the definition of $\_\sim_\setoidU\_$ and
$\_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_$ in line with how we defined $\setoidU$ and $\El$.

However, this doesn't work in our case, since the type of $p$ \emph{is}
propositionally truncated, hence it cannot be eliminated to construct a
proof-relevant object.
%
Fortunately, we can work around this limitation by defining $p \vdash x
\sim_{\El} y$ by induction on the codes $A\ B : \setoidU$, in a way that ends
up being logically equivalent to the proposition we would have obtained by
$\ad{proj}_1\ p\ x\ y$ if there were no truncation.
%
More precisely, we need to construct proofs that for any concrete $R$ and
$\ad{inR}$, the types $| (R, \ad{inR}) | \vdash x \sim_{\El} y$ and $R\ x\ y$
are logically equivalent. These in turn need to be defined mutually with
$\_\vdash\_\sim_{\El}\_$. We direct the interested reader to the Agda
formalization for the full details of these definitions, as they are quite
involved.

The full definition of the universe is concluded with the remaining definitions,
like $\reflu, \reflel$, etc., which can be adapted from their IR counterparts
more or less straighforwardly. The final result does not use
induction-recursion, but it's nevertheless an instance of infinitary
induction-induction. The ability to define arbitrary, infinitary
inductive-inductive types clashes with our objective of keeping the metatheory
as small and simple as possible. The next step is therefore to reduce this
inductive-inductive universe to one that does not require (infinitary)
induction-induction.

It is known that finitary inductive-inductive definitions can be translated into
inductive families \cite{iit-erasure,iit-to-ix,induction-is-enough} but it is
not clear whether this extends to an infinitary type like our universe.
%
Of course, the absence of a general reduction method does not mean that
particular concrete instances of induction-induction cannot be reduced to
simpler principles, which is exactly what we hope for our universe construction.
